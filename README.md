To understand various data mining techniques comprehensively, we conducted analyses on two datasets: one obtained from the YouTube API and the other from COVID-19 data in Canada. The COVID-19 dataset was subjected to multiple analytical approaches, including cluster analysis, correlation analysis, trend analysis, and EVA (further elaborated in subsequent sections of this report) to identify underlying patterns in the data. Conversely, while performing numerical analysis on the YouTube dataset, the primary focus was text mining techniques. Specifically, sentiment analysis served as the core algorithm employed in this aspect of the project. Additionally, the utilization of the YouTube API also acts as a stepping stone to the subsequent module on collaborative filtering.
It is worth noting that running main requires changing the value of api_key variable using oneâ€™s own YouTube API key, however, other modules can still analyze already gathered results without it.
